# Reef
![ReefScreenShot](Reef.png "Screenshot of Reef color scheme in Dribbblish theme.")
I wanted to create a color scheme for [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) that resembled a coral and navy theme.  Although, the scheme I wanted wasn't available in the [Dribbblish Theme](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Dribbblish), which I also really liked.  So, I decided to blend the two to create my own scheme that would appear in my preferred Dribblish theme.
 
 #Adding theme
 To install this as a theme, the easiest way is to paste the color.ini code into the color.ini file in the Dribblish theme folder.  I also had to hardcode a couple of colors into the user.css files to make it exactly how I wanted it.  You can follow the same process with the CSS as the INI file.
 
 #Implementation
 Navigate to the config.ini file for Spicetify and set the current_theme to Dribbblish and color_scheme to Reef.  To run the Dribbblish theme, you must also have the Dribbblish.js file installed.
